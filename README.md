# Problem
Lack of proper STEAM education for kids, to introduce them mainly into engineering and programming

# Proposed Solution
A plug and play platform that offers seamless integration of hardware and programming, with rapid and solderless prototyping without the use of a breadboard. This can be used to introduce kids into the world of robotics, autonomous vehicles, embedded systems, IoT etc

# Proposed Stack
Embedded C++, Multisim, Easyeda.

# Benefits
To provide a fun way to introduce kids to programming and hardware development

To create STEM awareness among kids

To lead them into STEM careers, as the future will be based on pure STEM applications
