# Problem
Lack of proper STEAM education for kids, to introduce them mainly into engineering and programming

# Proposed Solution
A plug and play platform that offers seamless integration of hardware and programming, with rapid and solderless prototyping without the use of a breadboard. This can be used to introduce kids into the world of robotics, autonomous vehicles, embedded systems, IoT etc
